Project created by Artur Galeno Muniz

The objective that project is apply developers a simple way to do android context oriented applications.

For now, that version is implementated for use with AndroidAnnotations framework.

That version is just a useful simple implementation of an ideia. Fell free to fork and improve.

Usage:

@ContextAware
 
This annotation is used to annotate methods that is context orientated, you can specify the atributes "before" or "after". If you use "before", that method will be executed before the interceptor method "interceptBefore", if you use "after", that method will be executed after the interceptor method "interceptAfter". You can specify both too.

public class foo {

	@ContextAware(before=true,after=true)
	public boolean method() {
		.
		.
		.
	}
}

InterceptorTemplate Class

To use correctly @ContextAware some other implementations are necessary, the interceptor is mandatory. You must to extend InterceptorTemplate to implement the methods "intercetBefore" and "interceptAfter"

public class MyInterceptor extends InterceptorTemplate {
	
	@Override
	public boolean interceptBefore() {}
	@Override
	public boolean interceptAfter() {}
}

@Interceptor

That annotation is used to register the interceptor on the class that contain any method with @ContextAware annotation.

public class foo {
	
	@Interceptor
	MyInterceptor myInterceptor;

	@ContextAware(before=true,after=true)
	public boolean method() {
	}

}

@Mandatory

That annotation says the annotated method will execute only if the intercept method return true, in case of before=true, or only if the annotated method return true in case of after=true. Or both cases.

public class foo {

	@Interceptor
	MyInterceptor myInterceptor;

	@ContextAware(before=true,after=true)
	@Mandatory
	public boolean method() {
	}
}

IContextType Interface

This interface says that class which implements the interface is a context.
And force you to implement the "getInterceptor" method. This method must return the interceptor that you registrated on class.

public class foo implements IContextType {
	
	@Interceptor
	MyInterceptor myInterceptor;

	@ContextAware(before=true,after=true)
	@Mandatory
	public boolean method(){
	}

	@Override
	public InterceptorTemplate getInterceptor(){
		return this.myInterceptor;
	}
}

SimpleContextAware apply to use Otto framework. For this offers the BusManager class. But you must to use the Otto version compatible with AndroidAnnotation framework.
